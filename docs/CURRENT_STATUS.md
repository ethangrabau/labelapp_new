# Current Project Status - December 22, 2024

## Completed Features
1. ✅ Basic React Native project setup with TypeScript
2. ✅ Android environment configuration
3. ✅ Camera integration with react-native-vision-camera
4. ✅ OCR functionality using ML Kit text recognition
5. ✅ Basic UI for camera view and text display
6. ✅ Ingredient parsing with support for nested ingredients
7. ✅ Integration with Google Gemini API for ingredient analysis
8. ✅ GitHub repository setup with proper documentation
9. ✅ Camera UI improvements with scanning guide overlay
10. ✅ Low-light detection and automatic flash control
11. ✅ Scientific source citations in analysis results

## Current Status
- Working camera preview with OCR functionality
- Successfully scanning and displaying label text
- Robust ingredient parsing system that handles:
  - Nested ingredients in parentheses
  - Multiple ingredients separated by commas
  - Filtering out non-ingredient text
- AI-powered ingredient analysis providing:
  - Safety ratings (safe, questionable, warning)
  - Detailed explanations
  - Scientific source citations with URLs
- Enhanced camera experience:
  - Visual scanning guide with corner markers
  - Automatic low-light detection
  - Smart flash control
  - Clear user feedback
- Basic error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. UI/UX Improvements
   - ~~Implement visual scanning guide~~ ✅
   - ~~Add low-light detection~~ ✅
   - Add smooth transitions between screens
   - Create a better visual hierarchy for ingredient analysis results
   - Add loading animations and progress indicators

2. Enhanced Analysis Features
   - Add ingredient categorization (allergens, additives, etc.)
   - Implement batch analysis for multiple products
   - Add detailed nutritional information parsing
   - Create a favorites/history system

3. Data Management
   - Set up local storage for scan history
   - Implement caching for ingredient analyses
   - Create data models for ingredients and safety ratings
   - Add offline support for previously scanned items

4. App Polish
   - Add proper error handling and recovery
   - Implement proper Android permissions flow
   - Create app icon and splash screen
   - Add haptic feedback for scanning
   - Implement proper loading states

### Technical Debt
- Add comprehensive error boundaries
- Implement proper TypeScript types throughout
- Add unit tests for ingredient parser
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Implement proper environment configuration
- Add error tracking and analytics

## Development Notes
- OCR accuracy is good but could be improved with image preprocessing
- Ingredient parser successfully handling complex cases
- Gemini API providing good analysis results with scientific sources
- Camera UI improvements significantly enhance user experience
- Need to implement proper rate limiting and error handling for API calls

## Recent Updates (December 22, 2024)
- Added visual scanning guide with corner markers
- Implemented low-light detection and automatic flash control
- Updated Gemini API integration to include scientific sources
- Improved camera UI with better feedback and visual hierarchy
- Migrated project to new repository with clean history
